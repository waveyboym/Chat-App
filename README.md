# Chat-App
A real time chat application done with electron and react with a firebase backend

# Note
This is the old version of this repo, that should remain as read only. It uses electron whilst the version that is in main uses tauri. This version will no longer receive updates or fixes hence why it is read only. I am keeping the code up incase anyone might want to see it

1. Make a folder on your desktop named for example "ChatApp"
2. Visit https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate and follow readme instructions to download the boilerplate code\
                                        \
                                         OR\
                                         \
Clone Electron react boilerplate from github by running and naming your chat app project
```
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate.git <Chat App project name>
cd <Chat App project name>
npm install
``` 
3. Once that is done, delete all files in <Chat App project name>/src/renderer
4. clone the files in the folder labelled as "Source Files" from this repository into <Chat App project name>/src/renderer
5. In <Chat App project name>/src/main delete a file named "main.ts"
5. clone the file labelled as "main.ts" in the folder labelled "renderer" from this repository into <Chat App project name>/src/main
6. Open a terminal where your project is located <Chat App project name> and run these commands to install the necessary dependencies:\
(only install the one's you do not have)
```bash
npm install -g sass
```
```bash
npm install framer-motion
```
```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

```javascript
const firebaseApp = initializeApp ({
    apiKey: "<your API key from firebase>",
    authDomain: "<your authDomain from firebase>",
    projectId: "<your project ID from firebase>",
    storageBucket: "<your storage bucket from firebase>",
    messagingSenderId: "<your messaging sender ID from firebase>",
    appId: "<your app ID from firebase>",
    measurementId: "<your measurement ID from firebase>"
});
```
\

10. Open a terminal where your project is located <Chat App project name> and run this command:
```bash
npm start
```
11. To make changes, you can do so by going to <Chat App project name>/src/renderer and modifying any of the source files there and you will immediately see a refresh thanks to React's Fast Refresh
12. To make a production build for your operating system, run
```bash
npm run package
```

 # TODO
1. Improve load times between opening messages
2. Improve user interface for navigating between private messages and room messages
3. Add support for presence detection(whether or not a user is online)
4. Add ability to view all friends in a separate component 
5. Add stories/most recent updates
6. Maybe add more themes
